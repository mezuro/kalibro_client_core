## Development

### Ruby version

  `2.3.0`

  You can easily install it through the Ruby Version Manager - RVM. Instructions on how to do it can be found at http://rvm.io

  It is expected to work with:

  - 2.1.5 Debian 8
  - 2.0.0 CentOS 7

  *NOTE:* If you are using the gnome-shell, or any derivate like terminator, you have to mark on your profile the option to use a "login bash".

### Environment setup

  - Gem installation:
    - `bundle install`

  - Alternatively you can just run the setup script:
    - `bin/setup`

### How to run the test suite

      rake
